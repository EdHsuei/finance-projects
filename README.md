All financial models I wrote are stored here.
I love Trader Joe's but it's not publicly traded(fortunately), so I usually take Target('TGT') as example.
I am still learning, fortifying my knowledge about time series, statistical methods and the market.
Hence I hope if anyone can point out where I'm not being comprehensive enough or mathematically incorrect.
